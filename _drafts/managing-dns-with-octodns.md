DNS is a critical part of any infrastructure. It is the service that translates human-readable domain names into IP 
addresses that computers can understand. Managing DNS records can be a complex and error-prone process, especially 
in large environments with multiple domains and subdomains. OctoDNS is a tool that helps automate the management of
DNS records across multiple providers and environments. In this article, we will explore how OctoDNS works and how 
you can use it to manage your DNS records more effectively.

## What is OctoDNS?

OctoDNS is an open-source tool that helps automate the management of DNS records. It allows you to define your DNS
records in a simple YAML configuration file and then apply those changes to your DNS providers using a set of
built-in drivers. OctoDNS supports a wide range of DNS providers, including AWS Route 53, Google Cloud DNS, Azure DNS,
and many others.

## How does OctoDNS work?

OctoDNS works by reading a YAML configuration file that defines your DNS records and then applying those changes to
your DNS providers. The configuration file is organized into zones, which represent the different domains and
subdomains that you want to manage. Each zone contains a list of records, which define the DNS records for that
domain or subdomain.

Here is an example of a simple OctoDNS configuration file:

```yaml

providers:
  aws:
    class: octodns.provider.route53.Route53Provider
    access_key_id: YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    secret_access_key: YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    zones:
      example.com:
        class: octodns.zone.Zone
        sources:
          - config
        records:
          - name: www
            type: CNAME
            value: example.com
          - name: mail
            type: MX
            value: mail.example.com
```
