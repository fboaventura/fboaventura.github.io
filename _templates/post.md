title: # "Managing DNS with OctoDNS"
description: # "DNS is a critical part of any infrastructure. It is the service that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers can understand. Managing DNS records can be a complex and error-prone process, especially in large environments with multiple domains and subdomains. OctoDNS is a tool that helps automate the management of DNS records across multiple providers and environments."
